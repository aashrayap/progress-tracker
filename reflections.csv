2026-02-26,eating,"Did OMAD and noticed energy feedback in real time","Large single meal at ~3 PM was followed by a strong sleepy crash by ~5:30 PM; could be post-meal dip and/or weed recovery fatigue.","Tomorrow run a simple test: smaller meal load or split intake and add a 10-15 min walk post-meal; log energy at +1h/+2h/+3h."
2026-02-26,addiction,"Day 2 clean - stayed honest about feelings instead of numbing","Feeling very down and lonely. Moved from Calgary 5 years ago and haven't rebuilt a friend circle in Houston. Catching myself focusing on what I don't have instead of what I do. Unsure if withdrawal sadness or real sadness - probably both. Last time meditation helped pull out of this.","Restart meditation. Life is what you make it - there is a lot to be thankful for. Focus on gratitude not absence."
