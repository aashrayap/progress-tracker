# Progress Tracker

## What
Personal goal tracking: weight, AI/career, money.

## Structure
```
├── index.md      # Dashboard (the one page)
├── vision.md     # Why
├── meals.md      # Diet protocol
├── fitness.md    # BMR/TDEE math
├── finance.md    # Money projections
├── weight.csv    # Raw data
└── logs/         # Weekly history
```

## Rules
- **Minimal by default** - no bloat, no jargon, no "recommendations"
- **Expand only when certain** - don't add structure until it's needed
- **Data in csv, narrative in md** - keep them separate
- **Tables over prose** - concise, scannable
- **Delete > comment out** - no dead code or text
