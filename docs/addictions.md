## The Dopamine Trap

```
YOUR BRAIN ON ADDICTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Normal reward:        LoL/Weed reward:
    │                      │
    ▼                      ▼
  ┌──┐                  ┌─────┐
  │  │ dopamine         │     │ dopamine
  │  │ spike            │     │ SPIKE
──┴──┴──────────     ───┴─────┴───────────
  baseline              ↓ baseline DROPS

Over time:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Receptors downregulate (need more for same high)   │
│  2. Baseline dopamine drops (life feels flat)          │
│  3. Only the addiction feels "normal"                  │
│  4. Everything else = boring, pointless                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why These Two Are Hard

### League of Legends
- **Variable reward**: Win/lose unpredictability = slot machine effect
- **Social hooks**: Friends play, ranked status, identity tied to rank
- **Low friction**: One click away, always available
- **Escalating commitment**: "One more game" → 4 hours gone
- **Competence need**: Satisfies need to feel skilled/improving

### Weed
- **Anxiolytic**: Numbs stress/anxiety immediately
- **Sleep crutch**: Hard to sleep without it initially
- **Ritual**: Rolling, smoking = comforting routine
- **Emotional bypass**: Skip processing hard feelings
- **CB1 downregulation**: Natural pleasure feels muted

## Mechanisms That Actually Work

### 1. Replacement Stacking
```
OLD LOOP:                    NEW LOOP:
Stress → Weed → Relief       Stress → Walk/Lift → Relief
Bored → LoL → Stimulation    Bored → [X] → Stimulation
                                     ↑
                             YOU NEED TO FILL THIS
```

**High-dopamine replacements:**
- Lifting (natural dopamine + endorphins)
- Cold shower (norepinephrine spike)
- Walking outside (sunlight + movement)
- Learning something hard (competence need)

### 2. Friction Engineering
| Addiction | Add Friction |
|-----------|--------------|
| LoL | Uninstall. Delete shortcuts. Tell friends. |
| Weed | Throw out gear. Remove dealer contact. Tell someone. |

The goal: Make relapse require EFFORT, not just a click.

### 3. Urge Surfing (10-min rule)
```
Craving hits
     │
     ▼
Set timer: 10 minutes
     │
     ▼
Do ANYTHING else (walk, pushups, cold water on face)
     │
     ▼
Craving passes (they always do)
```

Cravings peak at ~10 min then fade. You just have to outlast them.

### 4. Identity Shift
| Old Identity | New Identity |
|--------------|--------------|
| "I play League" | "I'm taking a break from games" |
| "I smoke" | "I don't smoke anymore" |

Language matters. "I can't" = deprivation. "I don't" = identity.

### 5. Stack With Existing Goals
```
Your current system:
├─ 1,900 cal ✓
├─ 180g protein ✓
├─ 8k steps ✓
└─ ADD: No LoL, No weed

Same tracking, same discipline, compound effect.
```

## Your Week 1 Protocol

### Daily Non-Negotiables
| Time | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Morning | 10 min walk + sunlight | Reset circadian, boost dopamine |
| When craving hits | 10 pushups or cold water | Interrupt pattern |
| Evening | No screens after 9pm | Sleep without weed |
| Before bed | Write 3 things done today | Rebuild natural reward |

### Emergency Craving Protocol
1. **Recognize**: "This is withdrawal, not need"
2. **Delay**: Set 10-min timer
3. **Move**: Walk, pushups, cold shower
4. **Remind**: "Day X of 90. Dopamine is healing."

## Triggers Log

| Date | Trigger | Led To | Pattern |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Jan 31 | Lost poker tournament → late hangout with friends | All three (LoL, weed, poker) | Loss + social + late night |

**Known Trigger Patterns:**
| Trigger | Risk Level | Counter |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Losing (poker/games) | HIGH | Loss = dopamine crash → brain seeks hit. Leave immediately after loss. |
| Late night + friends | HIGH | **AVOID for now.** When unavoidable: come home, go to sleep. No "one more." |
| Boredom, evening | MEDIUM | Pre-plan evening activity |
| Stress/anxiety | MEDIUM | Walk, cold water, pushups |
