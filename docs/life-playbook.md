## Weight and Fitness

Current state:

- Age: 30
- Height: 6'0" (183 cm)
- Current: 245 lbs
- Goal: 200 lbs by Jun 30

Energy model:

- BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor): ~2,089 cal/day
- TDEE light activity (8k steps): ~2,872 cal/day
- Protocol target: 1,900 cal/day + 8k steps
- Expected pace: ~1.9 lbs/week

Cardio:

- Daily dog walks, 20-45 min conversational pace

## Workout Protocol

Rules:

- 3 exercises per session, mostly compounds
- 3 sets per exercise (2 for accessories where needed)
- RIR 2-3
- 30-35 minute cap
- Rest 2-3 minutes between sets

Rotation (completion-based, not calendar-based):

- Day A: squat / bench / lat_pulldown
- Day B: squat / incline_bench / cable_row
- Day C: squat / ohp / barbell_row

Progression:

1. Hit top rep range on all sets -> add 5 lbs next session
2. Miss reps for 2 sessions in a row -> deload 10%
3. Log feel/effort notes in addition to numbers

## Meals

Default meal system (elk bowl protocol):

- Lunch: 8 oz elk + 1 cup rice + 1 cup vegetables
- Dinner: 8 oz elk + 1 cup rice + 1 cup vegetables
- Snacks: carrots, beets

Typical daily total:

- ~1,400 calories
- ~115 g protein

Rules:

- Takeout (Fri/Sat only): bring exactly enough for that meal — no leftovers (Mezza Grille lesson)

Weekly groceries (baseline):

- Elk, rice, mixed vegetables, carrots, beets
- Approx spend: ~$125/week

## Addiction and Dopamine Recovery

Primary reset target:

- 90-day clean block for LoL, weed, poker
- Approach: cold turkey, zero negotiation

Core mechanism:

- High-stimulation inputs flatten baseline dopamine
- Early phase feels flat/irritable because baseline is recovering
- Goal is receptor and reward-system normalization over time

Known triggers:

- Poker loss (high risk)
- Late night + friends (high risk)
- Boredom evening window (medium risk)

Emergency protocol:

1. Recognize: "This is withdrawal, not need"
2. Delay: 10-minute timer
3. Move: walk/pushups/cold water
4. Remind: "Dopamine is healing"

Replacement stack:

- Lifting
- Outdoor walks
- Reading/learning
- Early sleep

Friction rules:

- Remove easy access paths (apps, contacts, environments)
- Make relapse require deliberate effort, not impulse

## Finance

Current:

- Net worth: ~$500k
- Strategy baseline: broad index compounding

Projection assumption:

- 10% annual return, no additional contributions
- $1M target around age 37

## Travel (Poland Focus)

Base: Houston, TX

2026 intention:

- 3 Poland windows: spring, summer, winter

Budget baseline:

- ~$1,300/trip (flight + food/activity)

Planning notes:

- Prefer booking 3+ months out for lower fares
- Avoid crowded holiday windows where possible
- Calendar reference: `docs/2026-plans/2026_CorpCalendar_11x17_final.pdf`
