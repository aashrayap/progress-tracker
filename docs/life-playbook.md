# Life Playbook

## Purpose
Single reference for behavioral rules and constraints across core life domains.

## Domains
- Weight and body composition
- Addiction recovery
- Fitness and training consistency
- Meals and nutrition consistency
- Money and long-term compounding
- Travel planning (Poland focus)

## Operating Priorities
1. Sleep and recovery quality
2. Eating clean and protein-first defaults
3. Training consistency
4. Addiction avoidance and trigger management
5. Deep work and execution reliability

## Weight / Fitness Protocol
- Maintain a sustainable calorie deficit with high protein.
- Keep training completion-based and log set-level data in `workouts.csv`.
- Progress using simple repeatable rules (small load increases, deload after repeated misses).
- Preserve consistency over optimization.

## Addiction Recovery Protocol
- Zero-negotiation boundaries for known relapse behaviors.
- Track triggers and relapse signals in `daily_signals.csv`.
- Use interruption sequence when urges hit:
  1. Recognize urge state
  2. Delay for a short timer
  3. Physically shift state
  4. Re-anchor to long-term objective

## Meals Protocol
- Default meal system with predictable groceries.
- Keep meal decisions low-friction and repeatable.
- Capture outlier meals and observed effects for reflection.

## Finance Protocol
- Follow long-horizon compounding strategy.
- Prefer low-complexity, low-decision systems.
- Track major changes as explicit notes/todos.

## Travel Protocol
- Plan windows ahead of time, track costs, and attach decisions to calendar blocks.
- Keep planned trips visible in `plan.csv` and related todos.
