2026-02-25,weight,245,gained back - refocusing
2026-02-25,note,priorities: no weed + eat clean + gym only. simplifying.
2026-02-25,note,[ADDICTION] Written at rock bottom - 245 lbs after 3 weeks of daily weed/LoL/poker. READ THIS WHEN YOU HAVE AN URGE: Even if there is a chance it would be enjoyable - weed will only bring me down and make me end up at the same rock bottom I have found myself many times. Energy and sleep get depleted. Weight hits ATH. Motivation and dopamine gone. There is no 'just a little.' Check the log - 0% success rate with moderation. The pain you forgot is real. You are reading this because your brain is lying to you.
2026-02-25,deep_work,1,worked on tracker app + AI interest
2026-02-25,note,Rock bottom day. Emotionally drained. Smoked and played league. But worked on the app and felt interest in AI again. Day zero - tomorrow is day one. It's going to be hard but sticking to it.
2026-02-26,deep_work,1,60min - tracker app + gym rotation. Insight: need to set intention before deep work or get lost in low-value tasks
