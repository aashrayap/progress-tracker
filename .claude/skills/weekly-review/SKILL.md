# Weekly Review

Run a data-backed weekly review and set next-week priorities.

## Core Sources
- `~/Documents/tracker/daily_signals.csv`
- `~/Documents/tracker/workouts.csv`
- `~/Documents/tracker/reflections.csv`
- `~/Documents/tracker/plan.csv`
- `~/Documents/tracker/todos.csv`

## Structure
1. Metrics (targets vs actuals)
2. Current streaks
3. Wins (specific)
4. Misses / risk patterns
5. Next-week focus (max 3)

## Rules
- Use actual logged data only.
- Highlight patterns, not anecdotes.
- Keep next week simple and actionable.
- End with one key obstacle and one key behavior change.
